##  📖 Overview

This project is designed to test your layout skills, with a focus on **Flexbox** and **Grid**. If you're becoming more confident with these layout techniques, this challenge provides a great opportunity to put them to use. The task is to recreate a social proof section, aiming to match the design as closely as possible.

While the challenge itself doesn't require specific tools, you are encouraged to use any technologies you'd like to practice. For this project, I chose to implement **SCSS** for styling and **ReactJS** for building the components. Both **Flexbox** and **Grid** were used to create the layout, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

###  🔬 What I learned

In this project, I focused on learning how to manage **backgrounds in a fully responsive way using only CSS**. This approach not only helps maintain a clean and efficient code structure, but it also avoids the need for additional HTML elements or JavaScript that would increase the weight of the page and add extra nodes to the DOM. By relying solely on CSS for background management, I was able to significantly improve the app's load times, making it more performant and optimized for various screen sizes. Additionally, I continued to practice and strengthen my **React.js** skills, especially in terms of building **reusable components** and improving the overall user experience. At the same time, I refined my use of **SCSS**, leveraging its power to organize and simplify the styling process, making the project more maintainable and visually appealing.
